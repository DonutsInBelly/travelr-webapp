# Travelr
## Carlin Au and Sree Vuthaluru
  
### Made with:

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* PassportJS
* MongooseJS
* MongoDB

### What does it do?
We intended for Travelr to be a group travel planner, a place where people could collaborate on a trip they might want to go on. This project hasn't touched a lot of the functionality mainly due to a lack of experience. I've never touched NodeJS or javascript until now. Doing this project was really challenging, but what I learned outweighed the difficulties I faced.

### Roles:
* Carlin (Front-end and Back-end)
* Sree Vuthaluru (Front-end)
